description: Audit and restructure the project's persistent doc layer (AGENTS.md, PLAN.md, docs/*)

Run the `context-curation` skill on this project.

Read `.opencode/skills/context-curation/SKILL.md` (or
`~/.config/opencode/skill/context-curation/SKILL.md` if installed globally) and follow its
run procedure from Step 0.

Two reminders that matter more than the rest:

- Step 5 ends with writing `docs/_tuning-proposal.md` and **stopping**. Do not create, edit,
  move, or archive any other file until the user approves item by item.
- Run `scripts/docs_inventory.py` rather than estimating counts by reading files. The numbers
  drive every decision in the run. Resolve the script relative to the SKILL.md that was actually
  loaded, whether the skill is project-local or global.
